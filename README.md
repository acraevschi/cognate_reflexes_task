# Cognate reflexes task
This project is dealing with the task of cognate reflexes prediction as introduced in [SIGTYP 2022 Shared Task](https://sigtyp.github.io/st2022.html) using the Transformer architecture for predictive modelling. The novelty of the approach lies in showing that a multilingual or multi-language family model, in this case, performs at least as well, if not better than models trained for each language family in isolation. The model performs on par with Mockingbird team's Transformer model trained on public software version of a popular Deep Learning seq2seq library (see discussion and references in the paper for details). All of that was achieved without applying more sophisticated data augmentation techniques used by Mockingbird Team.
